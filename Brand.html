            <h3>Product overview</h3>
            Airbnb can be accessed via either its websites or mobile apps for iOS, Apple Watch, and Android. Registration and account creation is free. However, before booking, users must provide a valid name, email address, telephone number, photo, and payment information. Some hosts also require a scan of a government-issued ID before accepting a reservation.Users can search for lodging using a variety of filters including lodging type, dates, location, and price.Users can create a listing by selecting the "Host" menu after logging in. A listing will not go live until the host is ready to publish. Pricing is determined by the host, with recommendations from Airbnb. Hosts can charge different prices for nightly, weekly, and monthly stays and can make adjustments for seasonal pricing. Hosts add descriptions of the residence, amenities, available dates, cancellation policies, any rules that must be agreed to by guests and are advised to upload photos of the lodging that is offered. Potential guests are required to message the host directly through Airbnb to ask questions regarding the property. Unless the host has enabled "instant book", in which case requests for stays are accepted automatically, a host has 24 hours to accept or decline a booking. After the reservation, hosts coordinate meeting times and contact information with guests

            <h3>Fees</h3>
            With each booking, the company charges guests a 0–20% guest services fee and charges hosts a 3% host service fee. For "experiences", such as walking tours, the company takes a 20% commission from the host.
            <h3>Financial benefits</h3>
            Many people on the brink of losing their homes through foreclosure due to financial hardship have come to depend on Airbnb for additional income. In the U.S., homeowners who refinance their mortgages with some agencies are able to count income they earn from their Airbnb rentals on their refinance loan applications.
